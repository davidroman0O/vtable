## ðŸš¨ **Critical Architecture Fix Needed**

**The CORRECT flow should be:**

1. **User presses Space** â†’ `SelectCurrentMsg` 
2. **List** â†’ Calls `dataSource.SetSelected(index, !currentState)` 
3. **DataSource** â†’ Updates its internal state, returns `SelectionResponseMsg`
4. **List** â†’ Receives response, triggers chunk refresh 
5. **DataSource** â†’ Returns chunks with updated `Data[T].Selected` field
6. **List** â†’ Renders with correct selection indicators

**current incorrectly:**
- Managing selection state in the List component
- Not delegating to DataSource 
- Not using the proper command/response flow

## âœ… **What Done So Far:**
1. âœ… Added selection methods to DataSource interface
2. âœ… Added SelectionResponseMsg and SelectionChangedMsg
3. âœ… Added corresponding commands
4. âœ… Updated basic usage DataSource to implement selection methods

## ðŸ”§ **What I Still Need to Fix:**
1. **Remove all local selection state from List** (selectedItems, selectedOrder, selectAllActive)
2. **Add missing selection response handlers** (handleSelectClear, handleSelectionResponse, etc.)
3. **Make selection methods delegate to DataSource via commands**
4. **Update chunks when DataSource reports selection changes**
5. **Make View() read selection state from Data[T].Selected field only**

The architecture you described is **100% correct** - the DataSource should own selection state and provide feedback via the pure Tea command/message pattern. Let me continue fixing the List implementation to follow this pattern properly.

Would you like me to continue fixing the List implementation to properly delegate selection to the DataSource? 

The core insight is: **List = View Layer, DataSource = State Layer** with async communication via commands/messages! ðŸŽ¯
