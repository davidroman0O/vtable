# The Tree Component: Cascading Selection

A key feature for any tree view is **cascading selection**. This is the intuitive behavior where selecting a parent node (a folder) automatically selects all of its children and grandchildren. This guide will show you how to enable this feature with a single line of configuration.

## What You'll Build

We will take our basic file tree and enable cascading selection. When you select a folder, all its contents will be instantly selected as well, providing clear visual feedback.

![VTable Cascading Selection Example](examples/cascading-selection/cascading-selection.gif)

This is essential for operations like "delete folder," "move folder," or applying permissions to an entire directory structure.

## How It Works

Cascading selection is a built-in feature of the `TreeList` component. When enabled:
1.  You send a `core.SelectCurrentCmd()` for a parent node.
2.  The `TreeList` component receives the command.
3.  It identifies the node and all of its descendants in the tree hierarchy.
4.  It issues selection requests for the parent *and all its children* to the `DataSource`.
5.  The view refreshes, showing the entire branch as selected.

## Step 1: Enable Cascading Selection

This powerful feature is controlled by a single boolean flag in your `TreeConfig`.

```go
// In your main function:
treeConfig := tree.DefaultTreeConfig()

// Enable cascading selection. That's it!
treeConfig.CascadingSelection = true
```

**Prerequisite:** Your `ListConfig` must have `SelectionMode` set to `core.SelectionMultiple`, as cascading selection inherently requires selecting more than one item.

```go
listConfig := core.ListConfig{
    // ...
    SelectionMode: core.SelectionMultiple, // REQUIRED
}
```

## Step 2: Ensure Visual Feedback

For cascading selection to be useful, users must *see* what has been selected. We'll use the same custom formatter from the previous guide, which applies a background color to selected items.

```go
func fileTreeFormatter(item core.Data[any], /* ... */) string {
	if flatItem, ok := item.Item.(tree.FlatTreeItem[FileItem]); ok {
		content := flatItem.Item.String()

		// This style will now be applied to the parent AND all children.
		if item.Selected {
			return lipgloss.NewStyle().
				Background(lipgloss.Color("12")). // Blue background
				Foreground(lipgloss.Color("15")). // White text
				Render(content)
		}
		return content
	}
	return fmt.Sprintf("%v", item.Item)
}
```

## Step 3: Track and Display the Selection Count

To make the effect of cascading selection obvious, let's display the total number of selected items in the UI.

```go
// In your app's View method:
func (app *App) View() string {
    // Get the current selection count from the tree component.
	selectionCount := app.tree.GetSelectionCount()
	selectionInfo := fmt.Sprintf("Selected: %d items", selectionCount)

    // ... display selectionInfo ...
}
```
When you select a folder, you will see this count jump, confirming that all descendants were selected.

## What You'll Experience

1.  **Navigate** to a folder with children (e.g., `src`).
2.  **Press spacebar**. The folder itself and all files and subfolders within it will instantly change their appearance to the "selected" style.
3.  **Watch the count**: The "Selected items" counter will increase by the total number of nodes in that branch.
4.  **Deselect**: Press spacebar again on the parent folder to deselect the entire branch.

## Complete Example

See the full working code for this guide in the examples directory:
[`docs/04-tree-component/examples/cascading-selection/`](examples/cascading-selection/)

To run it:
```bash
cd docs/04-tree-component/examples/cascading-selection
go run main.go
```

## What's Next?

You've now implemented a core feature of powerful tree interfaces. Next, let's customize the visual markers of the tree itself by changing the expand and collapse symbols.
